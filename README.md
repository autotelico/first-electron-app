# First Electron App

I've used [Azer Maslow's guide](https://medium.com/@azer.maslow/creating-desktop-applications-with-electron-and-react-b7f81f78c9d5) as reference

This app:
- Runs React on a localhost port
- Runs Electron, displaying the content being sent to that port

Still learning how to write this in Prod but I believe I'll have to read up on [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/index.html)
